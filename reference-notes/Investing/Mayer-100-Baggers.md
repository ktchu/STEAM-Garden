## TL;DR

### Foundational Ideas

* __The Power of Compounding__. _Compounding over a long period of time_ is a critical
  component of achieving large investment returns.

  * ___Patience and fortitude (or negligence)___ is required to realize 100x returns.

  * The time frame for 100-bagger returns is typically on the order of multiple decades.
    There are some stocks that return 100x in shorter times, but those are rare and
    probably a result of special conditions that are not easily predicted.

* __The "Twin Engines"__. The stocks with the highest returns are those with both of the
  following attributes:

  * sustained strong earnings growth and

  * a large increase in the earnings multiple.

* __Many 100-baggers are "predictable"__. In many cases, it would have been hard to predict
  that a stock would become a 100-bagger. However, there are a large number 100-baggers
  that are predictable. ___The goal is to focus on these more predictable situations.___

* __Over the long run, market conditions, interest rates, etc. are just noise__. They may
  impact the stock price of good businesses over the short-term, but do not significantly
  affect the long-term return.

* __In an inflationary world (where money depreciates), asset-light companies do better__.
  Inflation negatively affects all companies, but it is less detrimental to companies that
  require less infrastructure to operate.

### Portfolio Management Strategies

* __Use a Coffee-Can Portfolio__. Buy stocks an place them into a portfolio that contains
  stocks you commit to holding for at least 10 years. Ideally, you basically never look at
  the portfolio.

* __Filter Out the Noise__. Learn to ignore the noise of daily, weekly, quarterly, etc.
  financial news that will only serve to distract you from your investment goals and life
  in general.

* __Be a Reluctant Seller__. Almost never sell (assuming that you have chosen good
  businesses to invest in).

  * Reasonable reasons to sell:

    * You made a mistake (i.e., the factual background of the company is less favorable
      than you originally believed).

    * The stock no longer meets your investment criteria.

    * You want to switch into something better (though caution is recommended here unless
      you are very sure).

### Searching for 100-Baggers

#### Critical Attributes

* __Business Attributes__

  * Sustained high return on equity/invested capital/assets.
    * The appropriate reference value will depend on the nature of the business.

  * Sustained growth in earnings (driven by growth in sales, margin, etc.).

  * Earnings a achieved at a _reasonable cost_.

  * Economic moat that allows the business to sustain high returns on capital over long
    periods of time.

* __Stock Attributes__

  * Growth in earnings multiple (i.e., market valuation of the earnings)

  * Not too large. Small companies can grow 10x or 20x (in either earnings or earnings
    multiple) still be small. Very large companies (e.g., Apple) cannot grow by the same
    factor.

#### Additional Preferences

 * Prefer lower earnings multiples at purchase time.

 * Prefer smaller companies (e.g., market capitalization less than $1B) ... but not too
   small that they become risky because they may not be strong enough to weather tough
   economic conditions).

 * Prefer companies run by owner-operators.

 * Share buybacks

### Quotes

* To make money in stocks you must have "the vision to see them, the courage to buy them
  and the patience to hold them." According to Phelps, "patience is the rarest of the
  three." --Martelli (in "10x Return Stocks in the Last 15 Years")

* "If a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive
  looking price, you'll end up with a fine result." --Charlie Munger

* "Never if you can help it take an investment action for a non-investment reason."
  --Thomas Phelps

* "Let us fall back on the principle that when any rule or formula become a substitute for
  thought rather than an aid to thinking, it is dangerous and should be discarded."
  --Thomas Phelps

* "Slumps are experiences to be lived through and survived with as much equanimity and
  patience as possible. Advantage can be taken of them more because individual securities
  fall out of their reasonable parity with other securities on such occasions, than by
  attempts at wholesale shifts into and out of equities as a whole. One must not allow
  one's attitude to securities which have a daily market quotation to be disturbed by this
  fact." --John Maynard Keynes

* "The problem with the 24/7 media culture we live in is that everybody has to have
  something to say almost all the time. And yet most of the time there really isn't
  anything worth saying" --Chris mayer

## 100-Bagger Portfolio Management Strategies

* __Use a Coffee-Can Portfolio__. The intuition behind the coffee-can portfolio is to buy
  stock in strong businesses for the portfolio and leave the holdings untouched for a very
  long period of time.

  * This approach helps protect you from yourself by reducing the chance that you'll not
    hold onto a stock during tough times (e.g., bad markets, weak business cycles, wars,
    etc.).

  * The only time to sell stock from the coffee-can portfolio is when the underlying
    thesis for purchasing the business in the first place is no longer valid.

* __Use a Focused/Concentrated Portfolio__. ~10 stocks.
  * Bet big on your best ideas.
  * Don't overdilute your portfolio.

* __Habits of Mind__. There are several habits of mind that increase your chances of
  achieving 100x returns on your investments.

  * ___Don't Chase Returns___

    * Chasing returns costs you a lot of money over time.
      * Dalbar Study. The average mutual fund returns 13.8 percent per year, but the
        average investor in those funds earned just 7 percent per year because they took
        money out after funds did poorly and put money in after they did well.

    * Don't measure yourself against _any_ benchmark (e.g., S&P 500). You have to play
      the long game.
      * Studies of superstar investors have shown that _non_ of them consistently beat
        the market and often lag it.

      * "None in the group always beat the S&P 500 probably because no one though that was
        the primary objective" --Barton Biggs

  * ___Don't Get Bored___

    * People do all kinds of silly things to alleviate their boredom.

    * In the context of investing, its easy to feel like you "should be doing something"
      … especially when the stocks in your portfolio aren't doing anything interesting
      while another stock that you don't own is making large moves.

    * Most often, the best thing to do is _nothing_.

    * Find other ways than "playing with your portfolio" to deal with your boredom.

  * ___Don't Get Snookered___. Be cautious of all of the following.

    * Management
      * Incentives often focus on short-term results.
      * CEOs are often charismatic, so it's easy to fall for their charm.
      * _Recommendations_
        * Read conference-call transcripts instead of listening to them.
        * Read several quarters at a time to look for inconsistencies in planning and
          language.
        * Be alert for evasive answers to questions.
        * Be wary if management appears to call on certain people frequently and receives
          no pointed questions. It could be a sign of a "staged call."

    * Boards
      * They're supposed to represent shareholders, but often there is a close
        relationship between members of the board and the company's management.
      * Board members often view their positions as "perks" as opposed to
        "responsibilities."

    * Lawyers and Auditors
      * Both represent the interests of their clients (i.e., the company) not the
        shareholders.
      * A "clean bill of health" from an auditor is no guarantee that there is no fraud.
        There have been several cases when audits failed to reveal fraudulent activity
        at the company.

    * Investment Banks
      * Don't look to research put out by investment banks or brokerage houses as a source
        of advice on where to invest. They are there to sell financial products, so they
        may not really looking out for your best interests.

    * Market Research
      * The purpose of market research is usually to add legitimacy to management's claims.
        It's not to help you make a good decision.

      * Look for more objective sources of information.

  * ___Ignore Forecasters___

    * Earnings estimates are often wrong … by a large amount.

      * Earnings estimates are generally over optimistic.

    * Other forms of economic and market forecasting are generally conservative and tend
      to be much less volatile than reality.

    * Consensus forecasts never get to the extremes. Unfortunately, the biggest gains (and
      losses) come from the extremes of the possibilities, so consensus forecasts typically
      only yield average results (whether they are accurate or inaccurate).

      * When forecasts are extreme, there is a potential for above average gains … but only
        if the forecast is accurate, which is often not the case.

### Business Analysis

* __Return on Invested Capital__
  * _Goal_: businesses that have a high return on "invested capital" (e.g., assets, equity).

  * The appropriate measure of "capital" to use to evaluate each company will depend on
    the nature of the business.

  * ___Over the long run, the growth in a company's value is is usually in line with the
    return of its underlying business.___

* __Earnings__
  * _Goal_: businesses with a growth path to increase earnings over an extended period of
    time

  * _Financial Clue_: high gross margin relative to competitors

  * When analyzing a company, it is important ___not to focus on reported earnings alone___.
    It is important to also consider ways that the company may be allocating its earnings
    to improve the business.

    * Earnings omit investment in _fixed capital_, so when capital expenditures are greater
      than depreciation, the net cash drain is excluded.

    * Earnings omit investment in working capital, so when receivables and inventory grow
      faster than payables and accrued expenses, the net cash drain is excluded.

    * _Intangible growth-producing initiatives_ such as R&D, promo/advertising, and employee
      education are expenses (i.e., not investments), even though the benefits will last
      for several accounting periods.

    * _Stockholders' equity_ is free even though owners have an opportunity cost. (In other
      words, companies can spend $50 to create $1 in earnings. If all you look at is
      earnings per share, then you will ignore the cost to generate those earnings.

* __Economic Moat__
  * _Goal_: businesses with _qualitative_ attributes that allow it to maintain
    "supernormal profits"

  * Economic moats allow a business to sustain strong earnings over long periods of time
    by protecting the earnings of the business from competition.

  * Economic moats are usually only possible in stable industries. Unstable industries
    make operating a business more challenging and creates opportunities for competitors.

  * Examples of economic moats:
    * strong brand,
    * customer loyalty,
    * network effects,
    * cost structure (e.g., the business is able to do something cheaper than everybody
      else),
    * size of the business (relative to the market).

  * Great management, by itself, is not an economic moat.
    * "when management with a reputation for brilliance meets a company with a reputation
      for bad economics, it's the reputation of the company that remains intact."
      --Warren Buffett

* __Creation of Business Value__
  * _Goal_: companies that business value over time

    * Shareholder equity is a decent measure of "business value"

  * Security analysis is good for weeding out duds (i.e., companies that show good earnings
    but increase shareholder equity).

* __Miscellany__

  * To find opportunities for 100x returns, it's helpful to focus on companies with
    national or international markets.

### Management

* __Earnings/Capital Allocation__
  * _Goal_: management that does a good job of allocating/investing earnings/capital

  * There are basically five options for management to allocate a company's earnings:
    * invest in existing operations,
    * acquire other businesses,
    * pay dividends,
    * pay down debt, or
    * buy back stock.

* __Owner-Operators__
  * _Goal_: businesses run by owner-operators

  * (Successful) Companies run by owner-operators typically exhibit the following qualities.
    * Management has a good business sense.
    * Management takes advantage of business opportunities when they arise.
      * For example, during times of uncertainty, they are not as risk averse as
        agent-operators (e.g., who often sit on cash during uncertain times).

  * Due to the way the index is structured, companies with owner-operator tend to be
    underrepresented in the S&P 500.

### Stock Analysis

* __Purchase Price__
  * _Goal_: purchase shares at a "relatively" low price

  * While it is beneficial to purchase stocks at low prices, ___it is more important that
    the business is able to generate high returns on capital___. Many companies that have
    a history of high returns on capital are well-known and may already be priced high
    (i.e., high earnings multiplier) by the stock market.

* __Stock Buybacks__
  * _Goal_: companies that consistently and significantly reduce the number of shares
    outstanding

  * Stock buybacks accelerates earnings per share growth by reducing the distribution of
    earnings across fewer shares of stock.

  * For companies where growth of the underlyng business has slowed (e.g., the market is
    saturated), the company may use stock buybacks as a way to grow earnings per share.

### Traps to Avoid

* purchase price too high. leads to reduced valuation growth ==> less return
* missing opportunities because the price seems too high.
  * need to look forward. it is not a requirement that a stock is cheap for it to become a
    100-bagger
* cannot focus solely on earnings
* watch out for stock buybacks that don't actually decrease the number of outstanding
  shares (e.g., stock incentives to executiives that effectively cancel out effect of
  stock buybacks)

## Additional Notes on Investment, Business, and Financial Analysis

* __Inflation__. Inflation is a extremely costly; depreciating monetary value makes it very
  difficult to create business value.

  * Inflation negatively affects all companies, but it is less detrimental for _the value_
    of companies that require less infrastructure to operate.

    _Example_ (from the book).  See's Candy vs. Gold-Oil Co (hypothetical company).

    * Both companies earn $2M in profits.
    * See's Candy has $4M in tangible assets. Gold-Oil Co has $18M in tangible assets.
    * Since See's is able to generate a higher return on capital, it has a higher valuation
      by the stock market.

      * See's Candy: $25M
      * Gold-Oil Co: $18M

    * Suppose that inflation doubles the price and cost of everything. Then to continue
      running the business (just to survive), both companies will need to spend about
      double their original asset value (in nominal dollars).

      * See's Candy: additional $8M
      * Gold-Oil Co: additional $36M

    * After inflation (assuming the same valuation multipliers as before inflation), the
      values of the two companies are:

      * See's Candy: additional $75M ( = (25/4) * 12)
      * Gold-Oil Co: additional $54M ( = (18/18) * 54)

    * So, See's Candy gained $50M in nominal value from $8M of additional investment
      (greater than 3 to 1 return) while Gold-Oil Co gained $36M in nominal value from $36M
      of additional investment (1 to 1 return).

  * ___A lot of people have a hard time understanding the advantage of asset-light
    businesses in an inflationary environment___.

    * "For years the traditional wisdom -- long on tradition, short on wisdom -- held that
      inflation protection was best provided by businesses laden with natural resources,
      plants and machinery, or other tangible assets ("In Goods We Trust"). It doesn't
      work that way. Asset-heavy businesses generally earn low rates of return -- rates
      that often barely provid enough capital to fund the inflationary needs of the
      existing business, with nothing left over for real growth, for distribution to
      owners, or for acquisition of new businesses." --Warren Buffett

* __Business Operations__

  * There are basically three ways for a company to raise money:
    * issue stock,
    * issue debt,
    * or tap the cash flow of the business.

## Notes from Studies of 100-Baggers

* __Miscellany__

  * In Mayer's study, the average time for a company to become a 100-bagger is around 25
    years.

* __Notes from Tony's Study__

  * The most powerful stock moves tended to be during extended periods of growing earnings
    accompanied by an expansion of the P/E ratio.

  * These periods of P/E expansion often seem to coincicde with periods of accelerating
    earnings growth.

  * Some of the most attractive opportunities occur in beaten-down, forgotten stocks, which
    perhaps after years of losses are returning to profitability.

  * During such perios of rapid share price appreciation, stock prices can reach lofty
    P/E ratios. This shouldn't necessarily deter one from continuing to hold the stock.

* __Oswal's Alchemy of Five Elements for 100x Stock Return: SQGLP__

  * S -- Size is small.
  * Q -- Quality is high for both business and management.
  * G -- Growth in earnings is high.
  * L -- Longevity in both Q and G
  * P -- Price is favorable for good returns.

* __Notes from Martelli's Study__

  * There is no magic formula to find long-term multibaggers.

  * A low entry price relative to the company's long-term profit potential is critical.

  * Small is beautiful: 68 percent of multibaggers in the selected sample were trading
    below a $300 million market cap a ttheir low. (They were microcaps.)

  * Great stocks often offer extensive periods during which to buy them.

  * Patience is critical.

* __Heiserman's Earnings Traps to Avoid__

  * Earnings omit investment in _fixed capital_, so when capital expenditures are greater
    than depreciation, the net cash drain is excluded.

  * Earnings omit investment in working capital, so when receivables and inventory grow
    faster than payables and accrued expenses, the net cash drain is excluded.

  * _Intangible growth-producing initiatives_ such as R&D, promo/advertising, and employee
    education are expenses (i.e., not investments), even though the benefits will last
    for several accounting periods.

  * _Stockholders' equity_ is free even though owners have an opportunity cost. (In other
    words, companies can spend $50 to create $1 in earnings. If all you look at is earnings
    per share, then you will ignore the cost to generate those earnings.

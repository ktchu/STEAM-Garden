### 3-7.

Write the Miller indices of the planes with the following intercepts.

#### 3-7.a.

__Problem__. $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, 1$

__Solution__. The reciprocal of the intercepts is $(2, \frac{3}{2}, 1)$. To obtain the
Miller indices, we multiply through by $2$, which yields $(4, 3, 2)$.

#### 3-7.b.

__Problem__. $\infty, 1, \frac{2}{5}$

__Solution__. The reciprocal of the intercepts is $(0, 1, \frac{5}{2})$. To obtain the
Miller indices, we multiply through by $2$, which yields $(0, 2, 5)$.

#### 3-7.c.

__Problem__. $\frac{2}{3}, \infty, \frac{1}{6}$

__Solution__. The reciprocal of the intercepts is $(\frac{3}{2}, 0, 6)$. To obtain the
Miller indices, we multiply through by $2$, which yields $(3, 0, 12)$.

#### 3-7.d.

__Problem__. $\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{5}, \infty$

__Solution__. The reciprocal of the intercepts is $(3, \frac{5}{2}, 0)$. To obtain the
Miller indices, we multiply through by $2$, which yields $(6, 5, 0)$.

#### 3-7.e.

__Problem__. $\frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{5}, \infty$

__Solution__. The reciprocal of the intercepts is $(6, 5, 0)$. Since this vector contains
only integers, its components are the Miller indices.
